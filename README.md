# ROMS_tools
Updated versions of Roms_tools (created by Trond Kristiansen, found here https://github.com/trondkr/romstools). Adjusted to include creation of initial and boundary conditions from SODA and WOA18. 

Simple creation of temperature, salinity, and free-surface conditions for use with ROMS model. Extra variables can be included with some edits to the base files. 

I am currently working on updating these tools for modern versions of Matlab since it uses some deprecated functions from the 2013a build.
